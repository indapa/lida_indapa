# LIDA Streamlit Application ðŸ“Š



The application demonstrates the luse of the [LIDA](https://github.com/microsoft/lida) library using Streamlit as a front end library. See [here](https://github.com/lida-project/lida-streamlit/blob/main/README.md) for more details. You can read the  [paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02927) and check out the project page at [https://microsoft.github.io/lida/](https://microsoft.github.io/lida/).

Currently, I have 3 baked in datasets that you can use to test the application. I am working enabling the user to upload their own dataset and use the application.

I'm really excited about LIDA because in order to do exploratory data analysis, you either needed to have some expertise in manipulating data in  R, Python, or Excel and plotting hit. LIDA allows you to do this without having to write any code. It's a great way to enable non-technical users to do data analysis.
