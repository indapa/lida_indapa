# LIDA Streamlit Application ðŸ“Š



The application demonstrates the use of the [LIDA](https://github.com/microsoft/lida) library using Streamlit as a front end library. See [here](https://github.com/lida-project/lida-streamlit/blob/main/README.md) for more details. You can read the  [paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02927) and check out the project page at [https://microsoft.github.io/lida/](https://microsoft.github.io/lida/).

Users can upload a CSV file with their data. The LIDA API will generate a set of analysis goals an associated visualization. Users can also enter their own analysis questions in the form.

I'm really excited about LIDA because previously in order to do exploratory data analysis you  needed to have some expertise in data manipulation and plotting in R, Python, or Excel. LIDA allows you to do this without having to write any code. It's a great way to enable non-technical users to perform exploratory data analysis on their own.
